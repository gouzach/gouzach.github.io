           Samu kerevi scored two amazing tries and was the star of the game also making a huge amount of metres against Argentina in 2016 the first try was where Dean Mumm gave an early pass to Samu then Samu Kerevi did a great goose step and completly ramed over the Argentinian player. He then had Bernard Foley to pass to but he didn't need Foley he wastackled but with the momentum Samu had he was tackled on to the try line so it ended up in a great first try.
